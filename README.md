TODO:
1. [X] Find a list of English words to use. For example [this one](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). Use python or linux CLI tools to select words I want.
    I made two lists â€“ `first_names.txt` and `last_names.txt` based on certain conditions.

    First name (result: 16692 words):
    - [X] starts with "B" (copied words beginning with B to "first-names-all.txt")
    - [X] is at least 6 letters long (`egrep '^[a-z]{6,}$' first-names-all.txt >> first-names.txt`)
    - [X] is not Benedict

    Last name (result: 33504 words):
    - [X] starts with "C" or "K" (copied words beginning with C or K to "first-names-all.txt")
    - [X] is at least 6 letters long (`egrep '^[a-z]{6,}$' last-names-all.txt >> last-names.txt`)
    - [X] is not Cumberbatch
2. [X] Write the program itself.
3. [ ] Figure out how to print the name capitalized
4. [ ] Think of implementation. GUI? Webapp?
