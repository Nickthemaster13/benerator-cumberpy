Description: ==================
        Benerator Cumberpy
        ==================
        
        Benerator Cumberpy is a name generator written in Python, that generates word pairs similar to "Benedict Cumberbatch". There already exist generators like this. However, they create new words, such as "Boobiedook Cumberfinkle".
        
        Benerator Cumberpy will create pairs of existing English words that fullfil certain criteria. Examples could include "Benefits Coordination" or "Benevolent Cucumber". There are over 480 million possible combinations.
        
        The script works both in Python 2 and 3.
        
        **************************
        Running Benerator Cumberpy
        **************************
        
        In your terminal, run ``hello-ben``. Your console will print a sentence like "Hello there, my name is Beetleweed Correctioner".
        
        .. Add info about importing and using in scripts
        
        For added hilarity, pipe the output of **ben-hello** through ``cowsay`` (`cowsay for windows <https://github.com/kanej/Posh-Cowsay/>`_, Linux – ``apt install cowsay`` or whatever else your distro uses).

        How Benerator Cumberpy works
        ****************************
        
        I found a list of English words to use. I used `this one <https://github.com/dwyl/english-words>`_. Then I made two lists – ``first_names.txt`` and ``last_names.txt`` based on the following criteria:
        
        First name (end result: 16692 words):
        * starts with "B"
        * is at least 6 letters long
        * is not Benedict
        
        Last name (end result: 28786 words):
        * starts with "C" or "K"
        * is at least 6 letters long
        * does not start with "ch"
        * is not Cumberbatch, though it wasn't in the dataset anyway
